## Overview
PixelProof is a state-of-the-art **deepfake detection** and **media verification** framework designed to protect digital integrity. Using advanced AI models, PixelProof enables organizations, journalists, and individuals to validate image authenticity, detect synthetic media, and mitigate misinformation risks.

Built for scalability, the framework wraps leading deep-learning techniques, leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers to analyze subtle inconsistencies in facial artifacts, lighting, and spatial distribution patterns. Additionally, PixelProof integrates AI-powered metadata analysis to assess discrepancies in file signatures and historical modifications.

## Key Features
- **Deepfake Detection**: Identifies AI-generated or manipulated facial imagery with high accuracy.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Processes images and videos on-the-fly with minimal latency, ensuring seamless verification workflows.
- **Metadata & Hash Verification**: Compares digital fingerprints, timestamps, and embedded EXIF data to detect tampering.
- **Model Agnostic Architecture**: Supports multiple detection models, including XceptionNet, EfficientNet, and Transformer-based detectors.
- **Scalable API**: Easy-to-integrate RESTful API with flexible endpoints for various applications.
- **Multi-Modal Detection**: Analyzes both images and videos, supporting frame-by-frame deepfake identification.
- **Continuous Learning**: Leverages real-world datasets to update and enhance detection models dynamically.

## Installation
You can install PixelProof via pip:

```shell
$ pip install pixelproof
```

Alternatively, clone from source for the latest updates:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/pixelproof/pixelproof.git
$ cd pixelproof
$ pip install -e .
```

## Usage
Import the package and start analyzing images:

```python
from pixelproof import Detector

result = Detector.verify("sample_image.jpg")
print(result)  # Output: {'verified': False, 'confidence': 92.3%}
```

For bulk processing and API integration:

```python
Detector.batch_verify(["img1.jpg", "img2.jpg", "img3.jpg"], output_format="json")
```

For video analysis:

```python
from pixelproof import VideoAnalyzer

result = VideoAnalyzer.analyze("video_sample.mp4")
print(result)  # Output: {'deepfake_frames': 34, 'confidence': 89.1%}
```

## API Integration
PixelProof offers a powerful API with endpoints for seamless integration:

**Verify an image:**
```shell
POST /api/v1/verify
{
  "image": "base64_encoded_image_string"
}
```

**Verify a video:**
```shell
POST /api/v1/verify-video
{
  "video_url": "https://example.com/sample.mp4"
}
```
